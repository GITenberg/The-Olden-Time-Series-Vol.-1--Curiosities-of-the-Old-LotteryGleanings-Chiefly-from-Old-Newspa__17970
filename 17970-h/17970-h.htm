<p>There appears to be, from year to year, a growing popular taste for
quaint and curious reminiscences of "Ye Olden Time," and to meet this,
Mr. Henry M. Brooks has prepared a series of interesting handbooks. The
materials have been gleaned chiefly from old newspapers of Boston and
Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be
history, the volumes contain much material for history, so combined and
presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some of
the volumes indicate their scope and their promise of entertainment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It has been the good fortune of the writer to be allowed a peep at the
manuscript for this series and he can assure the lovers of the historical
and the quaint in literature that something both valuable and pleasant is
in store for them. In the specialties treated of in these books Mr.
Brooks has been for many years a careful collector and student, and it is
gratifying to learn that the material is to be committed to book
form."&mdash;<i>Salem Gazette.</i></p>

<p>While this work does not pretend to be a history, it will yet present
many historical facts. Its object is to show from old newspapers, which
are not accessible to all, such items and comments upon a variety of
subjects as might be supposed to amuse or instruct both old and young.</p>

<p>It is not the easy thing that many imagine to examine, read, and select
from a vast number of newspapers such matter as is believed to be worth
reproducing. Possibly to some it would seem to be a stupid and an
uninteresting work. The Compiler, however, has found it a source of
pleasure to make and arrange these selections; and the value of his work
will be greatly enhanced if these volumes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
should prove of interest to
any considerable number of persons.</p>

<p>There appears to be from year to year a growing taste among the most
cultivated people for quaint and curious reminiscences of the Olden Time;
and as these volumes will be of a handy size for the pocket or carpetbag,
it is hoped that they will be welcomed by many who would not undertake to
read a more pretentious or cumbersome work on similar topics.</p>

<h1><a name="CURIOSITIES_OF_THE_OLD_LOTTERY" id="CURIOSITIES_OF_THE_OLD_LOTTERY"></a>CURIOSITIES OF THE OLD LOTTERY.</h1>


<p>People of the present generation who look over files of old newspapers
are filled with astonishment to see the great number of lotteries which
are advertised, for many years, down to as late a period as the year
1826. The Faneuil Hall Lottery, the Harvard College Lottery, the Rhode
Island College Lottery, the Massachusetts State Lottery, and lotteries
for a bridge over the River Parker, for Marblehead, for the Williamstown
Free-school, for Episcopal and Congregational Churches, were all
advertised, with numerous other projects. A lottery was proposed for the
purpose of finishing Bunker Hill Monument, although the scheme was not
carried out. It is perhaps not generally remembered that this monument
was at length completed by means furnished by a Ladies' Fair, in 1840,
and handsome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
contributions by several individuals. Among other
contributors was the celebrated <i>danseuse</i> Fanny Ellsler, who was at that
time giving performances in Boston. Some of the best men in the community
were interested in recommending the various schemes, and members of
churches, men in high repute, bought and sold the tickets. In Salem,
Mass., such well-known and esteemed citizens as John Jenks, Daniel Jenks,
Thomas C. Cushing, of the "Gazette," John Dabney, the postmaster, Colonel
John Russell, and the now venerable and respected Edward H. Payson&mdash;who,
at the age of eighty, is still cashier of the First National (formerly
the Commercial) Bank, to which office he was elected in 1826&mdash;sold
tickets; so did Colonel John Hathorne. Colonel Henry Whipple, who is
remembered as one of our best citizens, kept, in connection with his
bookstore, a "Fortunate Lottery Office." Other names might be mentioned,
but we think we have given enough to show the respectability of the
calling. The better the man, the better the agent. Indeed, it was
generally thought to be just as respectable to sell lottery-tickets as to
sell Bibles; and we have seen them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
classed together in the same
advertisement. Our observations have been confined chiefly to Boston and
Salem prints, but we have no doubt that similar matter could be found in
other papers. We propose now to give liberal extracts from some of the
old advertisements of the different schemes, which will, we think,
confirm what we have already said on the subject. Let us take first from
the "Boston Gazette" of May 19, 1760, the lottery to raise $1,000 towards
building a bridge over the River Parker, in Newbury. The managers were
the first men in the place, and the tickets were sold by men of excellent
standing in Boston.</p>

Next we will take from the "Boston Post Boy" of November, 1762, the
scheme to raise money to rebuild Faneuil Hall, after the fire of 1761. It
will be noticed how small an amount was reserved for the purpose for
which the Lottery was granted,&mdash;only $1,200. It seems as if a very small
sum subscribed by every freeholder would have produced more money. If the
population of Boston at that time was, say, twenty thousand, or three
thousand families, fifty cents for every head of a family would have
raised a larger sum than could possibly have been raised by the expensive
and questionable process resorted to. At first sight it may seem strange
to us that this was not thought of at the time; but when we reflect that
even in our enlightened times people are quite as thoughtless about the
processes of raising money for charitable or public purposes,&mdash;witness
the numerous fairs and raffles which are constantly taking place,&mdash;we are
not so much amazed at these old financial operations, nor do we think we
can boast much of our superior morality when we look around and see how
some things are managed nowadays.

<p>In 1782 the State of Massachusetts granted a lottery for the benefit of
the paper-mill at Milton.</p>

<p>The Clergy were often asked to use their influence to promote special
schemes. For
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
instance, the Leicester Academy at Lancaster, Mass.,
wishing to raise about $800, advertised on June 28, 1790, a lottery, the
scheme comprising three thousand tickets at $2.00; and the managers,
Edmund Heard and Ephraim Carter, say, "<i>As the de&#383;ign of this Lottery
is for promoting Piety, Virtue, and &#383;uch of the liberal Arts and
Sciences as may qualify the Youth to become u&#383;eful Members of Society,
the Managers wi&#383;h for and expect the aid of the Gentlemen Tru&#383;tees of
the Academy,</i> the <span class="smcap">Reverend Clergy</span>, <i>and all per&#383;ons who have a

unnecessary. As unscrupulous persons often sold drawn tickets,&mdash;for it

advertisement warrants the tickets undrawn,&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1776 the Continental Congress endeavored to raise a large sum by means
of a lottery. On the first of November of that year the following Resolve
was passed,&mdash;"That a sum of money be raised by way of lottery, to be
drawn at Philadelphia." A committee was then empowered to manage this
lottery, and agents were appointed in the several States to sell the
tickets. From causes difficult now to explain, the drawing, which was to
have taken place in 1777, was postponed from time to time, until finally,
it is said, the whole scheme proved a failure. Many of the adventurers
being large losers, much bad feeling was produced towards the Government.
The design was to raise the money in the way of a loan. There were four
classes of tickets, a hundred thousand in each,&mdash;$10, $20, $30, and $40;
in all $10,000,000. In Lossing's "Field-Book of the Revolution," from
which we derive this account, may be seen a copy of one of these lottery
tickets. Probably the people were too poor at that time to furnish the
requisite sum of money, and so the tickets did not sell readily; or the
lottery may have been badly managed.</p>

<p>Congregational Churches used to raise money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
by lottery, as appears by
the following advertisement in the "Columbian Centinel," May 5, 1792,&mdash;</p>

<p>At a town meeting held in Salem, Mass., on Dec. 28, 1789, "George
Williams, Esq., General Fisk, and Joseph Sprague, Esq., were chosen a
Committee to estimate the expense of clearing out the Channels in the
North and South rivers; and to prefer a petition to the General Court for
the grant of a <i>Lottery</i> to aid the town in so beneficial an
undertaking." We believe this project was never carried through; but we
are of opinion that some residents of Salem would now welcome even a
<i>raffle,</i> if in that way their North River could be purified, as at
present no other method seems so likely to succeed, judging from the
controversy which has been going on in that city for several years
without effecting any result.

<p>THE serious evil which has fallen upon a great many
adventurers, by purchasing Tickets in former lotteries, and
drawing blanks which were worth nothing; appears now to be
remedied.&mdash;The managers of the Fifth Class of Harvard

<p>The "Union Canal Lottery" was got up in 1814 to benefit Boston and "make

<p>It rarely happens that the object of a Lottery is
interesting to the whole community. To save the <i>Metropolis
of New-England</i> from declining in its commerce and
consequence on the return of a general peace&mdash;to open its
internal resources, to unite New-Hampshire &amp; Vermont to
Massachusetts, by bonds of mutual benefit, as permanent as
the rivers and canals, by which their intercourse will be
carried on&mdash;to make Boston advance like New York, supported
by a populous, extensive and productive back country, are
<i>considerations</i> into which every reflecting man, every
merchant, and every owner of real estate, must enter and
must feel. It is therefore, confidently expected, that a
Lottery, granted to complete
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
the great undertaking of
opening Inland Navigation, will receive peculiar support;
and that <i>many</i> who have not been in the habit of
adventuring in Lotteries, will be willing and desirous of
contributing to the success of this for the sake of <i>its
object.</i></p>

<p>The Highest Prize will be paid in ninety days after the
drawing shall be completed; and all other Prizes in sixty
days, and payment will be made in bills generally current in
Boston. Prizes must be demanded in one year from the end of
the drawing of the Class.</p>

<p>This Class will commence drawing in Boston, on the 12th
December next.</p>

<p>Tickets to be returned on or before the 2d December.</p>

<p>After lotteries had been drawn, notices frequently appeared in the papers
announcing the names of the lucky prize-winners. For instance, a Boston
paper of 1790 says: "The highest Prize (&pound;3,000) in the New York Lottery
was drawn by 2 deserving Servant girls of New York;" and in Sept. 21,
1793: "The highest prize in the 4th Class of the State Lottery ($1,000)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
was drawn by Mr. Benjamin Blodgett, of this town;" and the "Salem
Gazette" of 1815 says: "Luther Martin, Esq., has drawn $15,000, the
Highest prize in the Baltimore Hospital Lottery;" and it adds: "Those who
envy the good Fortune of Mr. Martin will call on Cushing &amp; Appleton for
Tickets in the Harvard College Lottery." In November, 1790, the "Salem
Gazette" says that the call for tickets in the Massachusetts Semi-annual
Lottery "has been so great in the other States that the Managers expect
to draw much sooner than the time which was at first mentioned;" also
that the tickets in the Marblehead Lottery are meeting with a rapid sale;
and concludes that "this does not indicate a scarcity of Cash."</p>

<p>On March 29, 1814, Messrs. Bridge and Renouf, the well-known brokers, of
79 State Street, Boston, gave notice that a prize of $500&mdash;No.
3,394&mdash;"had" been "drawn in the Plymouth Beach Lottery." This number had
been "sold by them to several young Gentlemen who purchased 30 Tickets;"
and they also announced that the drawing was "suspended until the next
Tuesday, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
first drawn ticket will be the highest prize, <i>Twenty
thousand Dollars;</i>" and besides this, that "there are remaining to be
drawn four prizes of $1,000 each, and four prizes of $500 each."</p>

<p>It should be noticed that there was, even in its most flourishing days, a
difference of opinion among individuals in regard to the morality of the
lottery, as men must differ on all subjects; so that it is perhaps only
fair to cite a specimen or two of the communications which appeared in
the papers in reference thereto. A writer in the "Salem Gazette," June
29, 1790, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'><i>OF LOTTERIES.</i></p>

<p>Lotteries have of late been a very productive &#383;ource of
revenue in this State.&mdash;The moral tendency of them has been
&#383;uppo&#383;ed by &#383;ome to be injurious to &#383;ociety; and
government have been careful to grant them for &#383;uch
purpo&#383;es only, as that the probable benefit &#383;hould
outweigh the evil. By this means we have &#383;een the
intere&#383;ts of literature &#383;upported&mdash;the arts
encouraged&mdash;the wa&#383;tes of war repaired&mdash;inundations
prevented&mdash;the burthen of taxes le&#383;&#383;ened, &amp;c. Manufactures
might al&#383;o in this way be e&#383;tabli&#383;hed. Tho&#383;e which
will not &#383;upport
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
them&#383;elves, it is true, will not
benefit the community; but there are very important ones,
which in their infancy require the nur&#383;ing hand of
government&mdash;to &#383;uch the produce of lotteries might be
beneficially applied. There exi&#383;ts a &#383;pirit of adventure
in all &#383;ocieties, which will lead a number to throw
them&#383;elves into the hands of Chance in one way or another,
&amp; which, under the direction of a wi&#383;e Legi&#383;lature, may
be made to &#383;ub&#383;erve their be&#383;t intere&#383;ts. The monies
rai&#383;ed by lotteries cannot impoveri&#383;h the community&mdash;as
they are not &#383;ent abroad, but only taken out of one pocket
and put into another.</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>There is also in the same paper, of Feb. 25, 1794, another communication,
in which the writer apparently takes an entirely opposite view, and
quotes a letter of Joel Barlow to the National Convention of France, in
which will be found some rather strong language. When one considers the
place where these views appear to have been adopted, and recollects the
horrible scenes of the French Revolution, which were even then being
enacted, one wonders whether the French authorities valued human life as
much as they did property.

<div class="blockquot"><p class='center'>ON PUBLIC LOTTERIES.</p>

<p class='smtxt'>MR. CUSHING,</p>

<p>AS our Legislature have lately had under consideration a
bill, for granting a Lottery to Harvard College, I beg you
will publish what our countryman, Mr. <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>, said
on the subject of Public Lotteries, in his Letter to the
National Convention of France. It is as follows:</p>

<p>"SINCE I am treating of morals, the great object of all
political in&#383;tructions, I cannot avoid be&#383;towing &#383;ome
remarks on the &#383;ubject of <span class="smcap">Public Lotteries</span>. It is
a &#383;hocking di&#383;grace of modern governments, that they are
driven to this pitiful piece of knavery, to draw money from
the people. But no circum&#383;tance of this kind is &#383;o
extraordinary as that this policy &#383;hould be continued in
France, &#383;ince the revolution; and that a &#383;tate lottery
&#383;hould &#383;till be reckoned among the permanent &#383;ources
of revenue. It has its origin in deception; and depends for
its &#383;upport, on <i>rai&#383;ing and di&#383;appointing the hopes
of individuals</i>&mdash;on perpetually agitating the mind with
<i>unrea&#383;onable de&#383;ires of gain</i>&mdash;on clouding the
under&#383;tanding with &#383;uper&#383;titious ideas of <i>chance,</i>
<i>de&#383;tiny</i> and <i>fate</i>&mdash;on diverting the attention from
regular indu&#383;try, and promoting a <i>univer&#383;al &#383;pirit of
gambling,</i> which carries all &#383;orts of vices into all
cla&#383;&#383;es of people. Whatever way we look into human
affairs, we &#383;hall ever find that the bad organization of
&#383;ociety is the cau&#383;e of more di&#383;orders than could
po&#383;&#383;ibly ari&#383;e from the natural temper of the heart. And
what &#383;hall we &#383;ay of a government
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
that avowedly &#383;teps
forward, with the in&#383;olence of an open enemy, and creates
a new vice, for the &#383;ake of loading it with a tax? What
right has &#383;uch a government to puni&#383;h our follies? And
who can look without di&#383;gu&#383;t on the impious figure it
makes, in holding the &#383;courge in one hand, and the
temptation in the other? You cannot he&#383;itate to declare,
in your con&#383;titution, <span class='smtxt'>THAT ALL LOTTERIES SHALL BE FOREVER
ABOLISHED</span>."</p>

<p>In November last, the Convention, in conformity with the
foregoing sentiments, passed the following decree:</p>

<p>"Lotteries, of whatever nature they may be, or under
whatever denomination they may exi&#383;t, are &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed."</p></div>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>In 1791 the Massachusetts Legislature granted to the proprietors of the
Cotton Manufactory in Beverly four hundred tickets in the lottery about
to be drawn, and three hundred in the next Semi-annual State Lottery.
"Some people, out-doors," says the "Salem Gazette," March 8, 1791,
"murmur at this as an ill-judged act of liberality; but perhaps they are
not acquainted with the arguments which induced the grant. The
disposition of Government to foster our infant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
manufactures is certainly
laudable." This is unquestionably good reasoning; for, granted the
premises that lotteries are ever beneficial, then there was no reason why
aid should not in this way be extended to business enterprises which were
to give employment to the people, as well as to schools and colleges.
Employment must be provided as well as education. The Beverly Cotton
Manufactory, Stone, in his History of Beverly, claims to be the first
manufactory of its kind established in America, that at Pawtucket having
been the second; and he also states that it was visited by General
Washington on his tour through the country in 1789. The leading
proprietors in this enterprise were George and Andrew Cabot, Israel
Thorndike and Henry Higginson, men of the highest reputation in New
England for integrity and honor.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the "Salem Gazette," Dec. 25, 1812:</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Ezra Sampson</span>, author of the Beauties of the
Bible, is one of the mo&#383;t u&#383;eful little works of this

Hi&#383;tory,
Geography, Zoology, Botany and Mineralogy, arranged in
alphabetical order, and explained in &#383;uch a neat and
intelligible manner, as to render it worthy of being
(according to its de&#383;ign) a <i>Companion for Youth.</i> We
&#383;elect the following article as a &#383;pecimen of the work.</p>


<p class='center'>LOTTERY,</p>

<p class='smtxt'>A kind of public game at hazard, in order to raise money for
the service of the state. A lottery consists of several
numbers of blanks and prizes, which are drawn out of wheels,
one of which contains the numbers of the tickets, and the
other the corresponding blanks and prizes. Besides the
consideration that this, as well as all other kinds of
gambling for money, tends to corrupt the public morals, it
is also to be considered that the purchasers of the tickets
are never permitted to play the game on fair and equal
ground. The world neither ever saw, nor ever will see, a
perfectly fair lottery; or one in which the whole gain
compensated the whole loss; because the undertaker could
make nothing by it. In lotteries the tickets are really not
worth the price which is paid by the original purchasers,
and yet they often sell in the market at a considerable
advance: the vain hope of gaining some of the great prizes
is the cause of this demand. In order to have a better
chance for some of the large prizes, some people purchase
several tickets, and others small shares in a still greater
number. There is not, however, a more certain proposition in
mathematics, than that the more tickets you adventure upon,
the more likely you are to be a loser. Adventure upon all
the tickets in the lottery and you lose for certain; and the
greater the number of your tickets, the nearer you approach
to this certainty.</p>

<p>The above is &#383;urely a ju&#383;t account of the nature and
principles of a Lottery; yet it does not de&#383;troy the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
fact, that, di&#383;tributed as the tickets always are among
thou&#383;ands, there mu&#383;t be &#383;ome gainers, and that, in
&#383;pite of mathematics, there is a lucky number, which
mu&#383;t draw the capital prize in the Plymouth Beach Lottery
(without any deduction) of 12000 dollars. Both the
<i>Hi&#383;torical Dictionary</i> and Lottery <i>Tickets</i> may be had
at Cu&#383;hing &amp; Appleton's old &#383;tand, one door we&#383;t of

<p>To show how largely men's minds&mdash;and perhaps women's too&mdash;were filled
with the lottery mania, if we may so call it, in the days of which we are
writing, we will introduce a Southern scheme from the "Petersburg
Intelligencer" of 1816, copied in the "Salem Register," September 11 of
that year. Some of our readers may think that it is not a bad idea.</p>

<p class='center'>MATRIMONIAL LOTTERY.</p>

<p>On the 21&#383;t day of December la&#383;t, I was pa&#383;&#383;ing
through the &#383;tate of South Carolina, and in the evening
arrived in the &#383;uburbs of the town of &mdash;&mdash;, where I had an
acquaintance, on whom I called. I was quickly informed that
the family was invited to a wedding at a neighboring
hou&#383;e, and on being reque&#383;ted, I changed my clothes and
went with them. As &#383;oon as the young couple were married,
the company was &#383;eated, and a profound &#383;ilence
en&#383;ued&mdash;(the man of the hou&#383;e was religious.) A young
Lawyer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
then aro&#383;e, and addre&#383;&#383;ed the company very
hand&#383;omely, and in fini&#383;hing his di&#383;cour&#383;e begged
leave to offer a new &#383;cheme of matrimony, which he
believed and hoped would be beneficial. And obtaining leave
he propo&#383;ed:</p>

<p>That one man in the company &#383;hould be &#383;elected as
pre&#383;ident; that this pre&#383;ident &#383;hould be duly &#383;worn
to keep entirely &#383;ecret all the communications that
&#383;hould be forwarded to him in his official department that
night: and each unmarried gentleman and lady &#383;hould write
his or her name on a piece of paper, and under it place the
per&#383;on's name whom they wi&#383;hed to marry; then hand it to
the pre&#383;ident for in&#383;pection, and if any gentleman and
lady had reciprocally cho&#383;en each other, the pre&#383;ident
was to inform each of the re&#383;ult; and tho&#383;e who had not
been reciprocal in their choices, &#383;hould have their choice
kept entirely &#383;ecret.</p>

<p>After the appointment of the pre&#383;ident, the communications
were accordingly handed up to the chair, and it was found
that twelve young gentlemen and ladies had made reciprocal
choices; but whom they had cho&#383;en remained a &#383;ecret to
all but them&#383;elves and the pre&#383;ident.&mdash;The
conver&#383;ation changed and the company re&#383;pectively
retired.</p>

<p>Now hear the conclu&#383;ion. I was pa&#383;&#383;ing through the &#383;ame
place on the 14th of March following, and was informed that
eleven of the twelve matches had been &#383;olemnized, and that
the young gentlemen of eight couples of the eleven had
declared that their diffidence was &#383;o great that they
certainly &#383;hould not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
have addre&#383;&#383;ed their re&#383;pective
wives, if the above &#383;cheme had not been introduced.&mdash;&#9758;
Gentlemen under 20 and ladies under 15 were excluded as
unmarriageable.</p>

<p>You will be plea&#383;ed to let the public hear of this
&#383;cheme, and I hope it will be productive of much good, by
being practi&#383;ed in Virginia.</p>

<p class='right'><i>A Married Man without Children.</i></p></div>

<p>The weak spot in this plan, we imagine, would be the difficulty in
keeping the <i>blanks</i> entirely secret.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>We have not undertaken to give an account of all the lotteries of which
we have seen advertisements, as our limits would not admit of it, even if
it could be made interesting to those who like to read about such
matters; New England alone would fill a large volume. We will name only a
few of the more prominent lotteries,&mdash;the Land Bank, in 1759; the
Pavement on Boston Neck, the same year. Then there was the Charlestown
lottery, the Hatfield Bridge, Sudbury, the Amoskeag Canal, the South
Hadley Canal, the Philanthropic, the Kennebec, the Dartmouth College, the
Gloucester Road, the Plymouth Beach, etc.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
All these, of course, were
public lotteries, and were managed by the first men in the community. In
relation to private lotteries it would now be difficult to ascertain the
facts. There must have been a great number of these; probably they were
not always honestly conducted. We have heard that there were shops where
the inexperienced were supplied with bogus tickets,&mdash;blanks of some drawn
lottery. Bad men, unfortunately, are to be found in all kinds of
business; but we know that in Salem all the men whose names we have
mentioned were among the very best in the community.</p>

<p>Although laws are now in force in Massachusetts and some other States
against lotteries, there appears to be no essential difference, as far as
the morality of the thing is concerned, between the old lottery and the
modern raffle,&mdash;and indeed a certain species of stock gambling, it seems
to us, is worse than either in its moral effects. After the year 1826, or
thereabout, lotteries appear to have become unpopular, and laws were
passed prohibiting them. Their unprofitableness, moreover, seems then to
have been more clearly seen. As we have already said, there had always
been some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
who saw the evils which must result from such schemes. Notably
among prominent men who in Massachusetts used their influence against
them were John Hancock,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Revolutionary fame, and afterwards governor
of the Commonwealth, and Peter C. Brooks, a distinguished merchant of
Boston, father-in-law of Edward Everett. The "Salem Gazette" of Sept. 16,
1794, says: "Considering the acknowledged immoral tendency of
<i>Lotteries,</i> it is astonishing how much is said in the Boston papers in
favor of that which our Legislature has lately instituted for Harvard
College. Our late worthy Governor Hancock, in a public address to the
General Court, gave his testimony against this species of gambling, so
calculated to ensnare and injure those classes of worthy citizens who are
guiltless of that vice in its common form."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Although we have seen lottery tickets signed by Hancock
earlier in life.</p></div>

<p>In some foreign countries and in a few of the States of our Union
lotteries are still lawful; yet we believe there is a growing feeling
against them. But if stock gambling is destined to take the place of the
lottery, we do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
not think much will be gained by the change. The losses
by lotteries were generally in small sums, and could be better borne by
the adventurers than the entire loss of property, health, and reputation
which is now too apt to follow a large proportion of the speculative
stock operations. In the lottery, too, the risks were generally so small
that the ticket-buyer alone suffered; whereas now, whole families are
often involved in financial ruin, if not in disgrace, by the operations
of a father, brother, or near relative. But we will say no more on this
point, as it is a consideration foreign to the object of this book.</p>

<p>Thus far we have written mainly of American lotteries; as it is not our
intention to take an exhaustive view of the subject, we will merely say,
in reference to foreign countries, that lotteries were instituted in
England in 1567, and abolished by Act of Parliament in 1823, although
allowed until 1826, when the last drawing of a legal lottery took place.
During this period they were patronized by all classes,&mdash;royalty, the
nobility, gentry, and commoners. The first lottery was for the repairs of
harbors and fortifications. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
drawing took place at the "west door of
St. Paul's Church." In 1612 King James I. granted a lottery for the
"English Colonies in Virginia, ... to be held at the <i>west end of St.
Paul's,</i>" and "one Thomas Sharplys, a tailor, drew the chief Prize, which
was 4000 crowns in fair plate."</p>

<p>To this day the lottery flourishes in most of the chief cities in Europe,
and lottery tickets are vended in many shops as well as in regular
offices. The Cologne Cathedral, as is well known, was only recently
finished by the aid of a lottery. Lotteries are upheld, we believe, by
the Roman Catholic Church in Europe, and many of the priests aid in
disposing of the tickets,&mdash;at least so we have been told.</p>

<p>The sum of the whole matter as regards this country is that a good work
was undoubtedly accomplished through the agency of the lottery in the
early days of our national history. By its aid schools, colleges, and
charities were founded, bridges, roads, and canals were constructed. In
our time public opinion is, of course, as it ought to be, against
gambling in any form; but although our ways are almost always thought to
be more honest, it is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
question, after all, whether we are really more
upright than our fathers, who sometimes engaged in transactions that are
condemned by modern society, but who, on the other hand, knew nothing of
"defaulted" railroad bonds, of "wild cat" oil companies, or of "watered"
mining stocks. It is easy enough to</p>

<h2>TICKNOR &amp; COMPANY'S NEW BOOKS,</h2>

<p class='center'>SPRING OF 1886.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smtxt">The prices named below are subject to revision on publication.</span></p>


<p><i>THE STORY OF MARGARET KENT.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry Hayes</span>. 1 vol. 12mo.
$1.50.</p>

<p>A new and thrilling novel of literary life in New York, written with
masterly skill. One of the most exacting of reviewers says that it will
"convince and touch thoughtful and sensitive readers"; and another, a
well-known novelist and poet, says: "The plot and situations are original
and natural. It is out of the common run, and sparkles with life&mdash;real
life&mdash;and deep feeling."</p>


<p><i>AMERICAN WHIST.</i> By G.W.P. 1 vol. 16mo. Sixth Edition, Revised. $1.00.</p>

<p>A new and fully revised and much-enlarged edition of this foremost
classic, best teacher, and wisest companion as to the most enjoyable game
of cards. After running through several successful editions during the
past five years, this invaluable book is now to be brought out improved
in many ways, and will be indispensable to all who play Whist.</p>


<p><i>CLEOPATRA.</i> By <span class="smcap">Henry Gr&eacute;ville</span>. Original Copyright Edition, with
new Portrait. 1 vol. 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"Cleopatra" is a brilliant new novel by the author of "Dosia" and
"Dosia's Daughter," who is acknowledged as foremost among the European
novelists of to-day. The remarkable success that has attended Henry
Gr&eacute;ville's previous works, foreshadows the popular demand for
"Cleopatra," her latest (and in many respects, her best) novel.</p>


<p><i>EVERY-DAY RELIGION.</i> By <span class="smcap">Rev. James Freeman Clarke</span>, D.D., Author
of "Self-Culture," "The Ideas of Paul," &amp;c., &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>An admirable group of terse, strong, and practical discourses on the
religion of the home, the office, the work-shop, and the field. It tells
how, amid the cares and annoyances of this workaday world, one may grow
towards a noble and peaceful life. It will be an invaluable companion, an
indispensable "guide, philosopher, and friend." The eminent success of
<span class="smcap">James Freeman Clarke</span> in works of this high class is shown by the
great popularity of his "Self-Culture," which is now in its eleventh
edition.</p>


<p><i>EDGE-TOOLS OF SPEECH.</i> By <span class="smcap">Maturin M. Ballou</span>, Author of "A
Treasury of Thought," "Due South," &amp;c., &amp;c. 1 vol. 8vo. $3.50.</p>

<p>A great new work, in which are preserved the choicest expressions and
opinions of the great thinkers and writers of all ages, from Confucius to
Ruskin. These pungent apothegms and brilliant memorabilia are all
carefully classified by topics; so that the choicest work of many years
of patient labor in the libraries of America and Europe is condensed into
perfect form and made readily available. It will be indispensable to all
writers and speakers, and should be in every library.&mdash;<i>Traveller.</i></p>


<p><i>LIGHT ON THE HIDDEN WAY.</i> With an Introduction by <span class="smcap">James Freeman
Clarke</span>. 1 vol. 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p>A remarkable and thrilling romance of immortality, illustrating by an
account of personal experiences the relations between the seen and the
unseen. All readers of the literature of the supernatural in books like
"The Little Pilgrim," &amp;c., will be profoundly interested in this strange
record of the nearness of the spiritual and material worlds.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Ads_18" id="Ads_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>TWO COLLEGE GIRLS.</i> By <span class="smcap">Helen Dawes Brown</span>. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>One of the most important of forthcoming books. It is a capital study of
girl-students from Boston, New York, and Chicago, exemplifying the most
piquant characteristics of the respective phases of civilization and
social criteria of the three cities. It is suited alike to old and young,
being rich in beautiful passages of tender pathos, strong, simple and
vivid, and full of sustaining interest. Nothing has been published since
"Little Women" that will so strike the popular taste.</p>

<p><i>INDIAN SUMMER.</i> By <span class="smcap">W.D. Howells</span>, Author of "The Rise of Silas
Lapham," &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>"Mr. Howells's new story is in his pleasantest vein, full of his quiet
humor clothed in the neatest expressions. It is international; the
contrast of American and foreign ways runs through it, and Mr. Howells
has added the contrast of the old and the new Americanism. The hero is a
Western journalist, a Mugwump, much given to banter of the American
sort."&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p><i>THE PRELATE.</i> By <span class="smcap">Isaac Henderson</span>. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>A story of the American colony and native society in Rome. The situations
in this powerful book are among the most intense and dramatic of anything
that has been offered by an American author for years.</p>

<p><i>CHRISTIAN SYMBOLS AND STORIES OF THE SAINTS.</i> By <span class="smcap">Clara Erskine
Clement</span>. Assisted by <span class="smcap">Katherine E. Conway</span>. 1 vol. Large
12mo., with many full page illustrations. $2.50.</p>

<p>This is a revised version of the greater part of the author's "Hand-book
of Legendary Art,"&mdash;of which seventeen large editions have been
exhausted. The clear and beautiful explanation of the expressive symbols
by which men's minds are helped to reverent contemplation of the
mysteries of revealed religion, leaves nothing to be desired. The
"Stories of the Saints" will be illustrated by numerous full page
engravings from the rarest and finest works of the great masters of
Christian Art&mdash;prominence being given to scenes from the life of the
Blessed Virgin, and pictures of the Evangelists, and the Founders and
notable Saints of the Religious Orders.</p>

<p><i>JOHN BODEWIN'S TESTIMONY.</i> By <span class="smcap">Mary Hallock Foote</span>, Author of
"The Led Horse Claim," &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1.50.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Foote's first novel raised her to a level on which she is only to
be compared with our best women novelists. To make this comparison
briefly, Miss Woolson observes keenly, Mrs. Burnett writes charmingly,

<p>The remarkable success of the first Monograph shows the demand existing
for artistic work of this high grade; and an equal sale may be predicted
for the portfolio that illustrates the beautiful marble Gothic building
of the Connecticut State Capitol. This possesses perhaps even a higher
interest than the Harvard Law School, because it is a great public
building, and not an appendage of an institution.</p>

<p><i>The American Architect</i> says: "The execution of the work is all that
could be asked. It would be hard to offer a more encouraging example of
the kind of work to be expected in this series."

full of high local color, pathos and piquancy, and their perusal is
attended with alternate tears and smiles. Their narration is vigorous and

Salem, sources not easily accessible, and while not professing to be
history, the volumes will contain much material for history, so combined
and presented as to be both amusing and instructive. The titles of some
of the volumes indicate their scope and their promise of
entertainment:&mdash;"Curiosities of the Old Lottery," "Days of the Spinning
Wheel," "Some Strange and Curious Punishments," "Quaint and Curious
Advertisements," "Literary Curiosities," "New-England Sunday," etc.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
